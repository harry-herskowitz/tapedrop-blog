Bruja/ˈbruːhə/ /ˈbruːxə/ Noun: Originally and chiefly in Spanish-speaking contexts: a sorceress, witch, or witch doctor; a woman who practises magic.

There is a difference between an illusion and magic. An illusion is something that appears to be one thing and ends up being another. Magic is an unexplainable occurrence that sends chills down the spine. The same feeling I got after experiencing a performance from the Delray Beach warlocks of rock, Bruja.

The band's caldron of genres range from Funk to Blues with a spectrum of other influences spicing the mix. Their lyrics speak of life lessons, personal growth, and self discovery that transport you on a journey through the inner workings of the Colombia-born brainchild of Bruja, Jorge Zarruk.

The bands name originated as a nickname Jorge obtained while growing up as a surfer in El Salvador, where his family moved to when he was an infant. A singer-songwriter and guitarist by trade, Zarruk’s passion for the Blues permeates into any project he touches. Armed with a hearty baritone vocal style, his songs can go from airy and uplifting to gritty and growling, but they never stray too far from being approachable to an untrained musical ear.

After years of working out the kinks and going through many lineup changes, the band has found their groove with current members Cory Ricardy on percussion, Tommy Rispoli on bass, and Monique Chalk on the keys. The band's chemistry produces a warm, family like vibe. They feed off of one another’s strong points and have a mutual respect for the collective talent the band offers as a unit. It’s the fuel that drives this passion project and it is amplified through their latest release “False Prophets” available November 1st.

Be sure to stay up to date with the band through their [website](https://brujaband.com/) and listen to their debut album “[False Prophets](https://store.cdbaby.com/cd/bruja2)” now streaming on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/4yxisJ39W5hieRgU8A06Bf?si=ALZatenVSmKzY52PSwoPQQ), [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/false-prophets-ep/1482570608), and all other major platforms.
