We were lucky enough to catch Reuben Hoch's Chassidic Jazz Project during Jazz Brunch at the Hotel Marseilles in Miami, FL. Hoch's blend of traditional Chassidic music and jazz is a joy to experience. The performance was part of the annual [South Beach Jazz Festival](https://www.sobejazzfestival.com/).
