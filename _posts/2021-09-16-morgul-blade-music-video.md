Philadelphia-based metal band [Morgul Blade](https://www.instagram.com/morgul_blade_hm/) released their first music video this month. Produced by [Ritual Video](https://www.instagram.com/ritual_video/), it is animated in the style of an 8-bit side scroller. The story follows a group of swordsman hunting down a dangerous [beast of Gevaudan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beast_of_G%C3%A9vaudan).

The video was released by [No Remorse Records](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc2JA2RL-97zdWNz71zg0PA), who signed the band after their first tape, [Harbingers of Power and the World's End](https://morgulblade.bandcamp.com/releases), gained a loyal following on bandcamp.

I reached out to Lord Klauf, Morgul's front man, to ask him about the band's sudden success:

> "It was very humbling. I initially started this project to just be a hobby to keep myself from watching too much tv and video games, never in a million years thought it would grow into an international label deal and potentially international tour next year."

I also asked for three bands to check out:

> [Malokarpatan](https://malokarpatan.bandcamp.com/)\
> "Slavic blackened heavy metal with excellent worldbuilding and strong melodic hooks"

> [Torpor](https://torpornoise.bandcamp.com/music)\
> "Polish 3-piece that plays Black Metal in the 2nd wave style with heavy metal overtones"

> [Black Magic](https://blackmagicnorway.bandcamp.com/album/wizards-spell-2)\
> "Evil heavy metal in the vein of 'Show No Mercy' era Slayer... Riffs for fucking days"

A Last Waltz of Gevaudan was recorded at [Red Water Recording](https://www.redwaterrecording.com/) in South Philly, along with the rest of Morgul Blades upcoming full length album "Fell Sorcery Abounds", out by [No Remorse Records](https://www.instagram.com/noremorserecords/) on November 26, 2021.
