NYCL Kai just dropped his new single "Bodies" along with a neck-breaking Music Videos.

Directed and shot by Connor Bewighouse (aka Pinkeeout) the video captures the high energy and euphoria of being enveloped in a mosh pit.

Kai goes absolutely off, back flipping into a crowd and moshing into a smashing finale you do not want to miss.
