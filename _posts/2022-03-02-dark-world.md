Friday, March 5th, Dark World co-founder and artist, [DJ Lucas](https://www.instagram.com/djlucas413/?hl=en), will be performing at the landmark venue in Montclair, NJ, along with appearances by Papa2oo4, Big Ovee, TrippythaKid, 89 The Brainchild, Subjxct5.

Over the last decade, DJ and his collaborators of the independent record label, Dark World, have brought lyrical and musical prowess, humor, and authenticity to the internet from deep in the woods of western Massachusetts. Their unique style is best showcased through the vast collection of raw, nostalgia-laced music videos on the [Dark World YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DARKWORLDMA/featured).

In a 2017 interview on the [No Jumper podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDbdPDl-m3E), DJ Lucas explains, “Dark World is just a thing. It just exists by itself.” At first glance, it may seem like a group of friends just having fun creating witty and self-aware music - and at its core, that’s what it is.

But at the same time it goes much deeper than that. The group values genuine artistic expression. They make the process about having fun and learning, which yields unique and creative music that a diverse audience can identify with. For these reasons, Dark World has grown an almost cult-like following.

‘Dark World's MO is repping small towns,’ said Lucas on No Jumper. The group recognizes that authenticity comes from loving what you do and having fun with your friends along the way. Coming from a small town, DJ can see himself in every aspiring artist with similar roots and is living proof that a balance exists between working hard and having fun.

In the No Jumper interview, the host Adam Grandmaison put it best, “I think music industry people and fans of the culture would almost think it’s cooler to see a Dark World basement show with a 100 kids there freaking the fuck out.” On Friday, March 5th at the Meatlocker, that’s exactly what’s to be expected.

Something special happens in the damp, poorly lit basement venues of small towns. Movements are born, trends and new cultures are created, and friendships are sparked. They are an active organism within the community that molds those who venture into the Dark World.

Doors open at 8:30pm at the Meatlocker in Montclair, New Jersey with a $10 entry fee.
