Last Friday Philly indie rockers [Dominy](http://instagram.com/dominy_music) dropped their Sophmore album Drugstore Cowboy. The rootin’ tootin’ four  piece preluded the release with two Music Videoss directed by [Bob Sweeney](https://www.instagram.com/sweeneybob/?hl=en). Watch above for powerful kicks and Estonian subtitles.

The new record starts right off with their signature  let-it-all-hang-out rocking and rolling. Crunchy guitar, fun and loose  vocals, and bar crowd foley make for a chummy time with your good pals  Dominy. Those not won over by the group can skip ahead to the track [Hey There Big Boy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqo5NxfzhiY).

The second half of the record takes a more serious tone. Cleaning Up  Good looks forward to a new year with a mix of hope and weariness. The  grand piano comes out for the ruminative Nebraska, and then the group  goes full dreampop on the synth heavy Judas. The final track is a  traveling, ambient soundpiece with vocal harmonies and heavy effects,  ending the album on a feeling of distorted grandeur.

[Drugstore Cowboy](https://open.spotify.com/album/4gqBF11RQk0vwgRKNcIoTB) is now available on major streaming services. Give it a listen and come out for the Release Show at [Philamoca](http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1859192/) on Saturday the 29th.
