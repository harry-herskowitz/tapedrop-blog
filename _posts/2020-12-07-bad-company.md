Somewhere along the Delaware River in a vacant lot in Camden, New Jersey, [Barney Cortez](https://linktree.com/barneycortez/) climbed aboard a retired school bus to debut his new music to the world. The song, [Bad Company](https://barneycortez.bandcamp.com/track/bad-company), is the third track of Barney's new EP, [Drive Thru Heart](https://barneycortez.bandcamp.com/album/drive-thru-heart). Barney showcases his songwriting talents in this lyrical collection of tunes.

The school bus and lot were provided by the eccentric guitar designer and artist, Phil Smith of [Goldfinch Guitars](https://www.goldfinchgeetars.com/). Phil and Alyssa Ritchie, the hooded muse of the video, were in the process of converting the bus for a cross country road trip at the time of the shoot. Also joining the cast is [Ali Awan](https://www.instagram.com/aliawan.wav/?hl=en), a fellow Philly musician. The video was shot and edited by our very own [Roldy Clark](https://www.instagram.com/roldyclark/?hl=en).
