With the sudden closing down of the popular venue [PhilaMOCA](http://www.philamoca.org/) due to zoning issues, [The Sloppy Boys](https://www.instagram.com/thesloppyboys/) had to whip together a new plan for the Philadelphia leg of their tour.  Luckily for Philly Slopheads, The Boys were quick to book [The Ruba Club](https://rubaclub.org/home) for their Friday night performance. They put on a hell of a show and  gave the crowd a night to remember. If you don’t believe us just watch  the video!

Their new album [DANCING ON THE WIND](https://linktr.ee/thesloppyboys) is now available everywhere.
