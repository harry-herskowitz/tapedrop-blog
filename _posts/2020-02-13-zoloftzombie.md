Zoloft Zombie, 24, is a rapper, producer, and spoken word poet from Trenton, New Jersey. Zoloft Zombie, or Zoza, has been creating music since 2014, gaining notoriety in the basement show scene of Rutgers University as well as on Rutgers’ internationally ranking spoken word poetry team, Lucid Language.

Aside from the occasional collaboration, Zoza produces all of his beats himself. The dark and dissonant tone of his music is accompanied by lyrics focusing on social activism and advocacy ranging from racial inequality to stigmas against mental health. Zoza describes his music as a vehicle of expression that has aided him in coping with depression, anxiety, and substance dependence.

Zoza hopes to inspire people to turn their darkness and pain outward through creativity and use art as a therapeutic practice. “If you have something inside you, don't procrastinate and get it out there.” These are words that Zoza lives by as he actively creates a platform for other artists to create and perform. Zoza hosts monthly basement shows at the venue appropriately named The Underwrld.
