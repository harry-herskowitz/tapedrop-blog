Brown Mills based rock band [Count Josephine](https://www.facebook.com/countjosephineband1112/) laid into the mics heavily after inviting the cameras into their  performance space.  This rendition of their song, “26000,” has sharp  guitar riffs, solid chugging rhythm, and powerfully crashing drums.   This track is a must listen for fans of classic hard rock.

Catch Count Josephine live at [Hollystock](https://www.facebook.com/events/585937495253286/) on September 21 and follow them on [Facebook.](https://www.facebook.com/countjosephineband1112/)
