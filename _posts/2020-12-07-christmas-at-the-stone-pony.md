'Tis the season to rock n' roll! In celebration of Christmas 2020, John Carr and his band [Count Josephine](https://thecountjosephineband.bandcamp.com/) took to the stage at [The Stone Pony](https://www.stoneponyonline.com/) to perform their Holiday single [Christmas Comes Once A Year](https://thecountjosephineband.bandcamp.com/track/christmas-comes-once-a-year-live-at-the-stone-pony-2020). With the help of our crew at Tapedrop, the performance was released on video in the style of a made-for-TV Christmas Special.

The song was written by John Carr and performed in true Jersey Shore style, featuring a classic four-chord rhythm, Springsteen-esque bells, and a wailing saxophone solo. It was a heartfelt tribute to The Stone Pony and the Asbury Park tradition.

We hope this special performance will be a bright spot in a Holiday Season that will be tough for so many of us.
