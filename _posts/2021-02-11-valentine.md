Lyrics:
Hey
Let's just stay in today
On this cold February day
All I need is your warm heart
And when
All the snow dries up
And your folks can come up
We'll have a picnic up on a hill
And we'll canoe on the lagoon
And look up at the moon
And Iâ€™ll kiss your tattoos, on your shoulder
Again and again
