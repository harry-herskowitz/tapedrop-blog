South Philly’s [Barney Cortez](https://www.instagram.com/barney.cortez/) released a Music Videos for his song Patti Smith last Friday. The video was filmed on Super 8 by [Bob Sweeney](https://www.instagram.com/sweeneybob/) and features French native [Aimée Landais](https://www.instagram.com/landais_m/). Most of the film was shot in [Roldy Clark’s](https://www.instagram.com/roldyclark/) home in Northern Liberties

The Super 8 film provides a French New Wave feel. Pairing the analog  film with a vinyl record player, cigarettes, and the vivid red color  motif makes for a retro romantic aesthetic – an accurate visual to  accompany Barney’s lovely serenade.
