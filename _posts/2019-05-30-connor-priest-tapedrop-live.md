Good friend [Connor Priest](http://instagram.com/connorpriest) was the actual first guest of Tapedrop Live. Connor played a cover of Â National Anthem by The Gaslight Anthem while we tested the new set. Thanks Connor! Check out his band [Minor Nelson](http://instagram.com/minornelson) on all major streaming platforms.
