We are proud to announce Tapedrop, the app! Available on web and iOS.

Tapedrop uses geolocation to connect artists with local music fans. How it works: Artists create a profile with their music links - Apple Music, Spotify, Bandcamp, SoundCloud, and YouTube. That profile then appears for users within the immediate area. Profiles can be added to a user's library for later listening, and easily shared. Shareable 'Artist Cards' are designed specifically for use as 'Link in Bio' pages.

Create your artist profile or start discovering new bands now at [app.tapedrop.com](https://app.tapedrop.com) or download the iOS app from the App Store.

For support, email support@tapedrop.com.
